# QNA Model Using Transformer API

A Transformer-based Question Answering (Q&A) system built using HuggingFace Transformers as part of my **AI Internship at WEINTERN**. This project allows users to input a custom context and ask questions, generating accurate answers along with confidence scores using a pre-trained NLP model.
