# QNA-Model-Using-Transformer-API
Developed a Transformer-based Question Answering system during my AI Internship at WEINTERN using HuggingFace’s deepset/roberta-base-squad2 model. The application accepts custom context and questions, generates accurate answers, and displays confidence scores, showcasing practical NLP and transformer pipeline integration using Python.
